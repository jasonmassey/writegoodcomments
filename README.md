## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasonmassey/writegoodcomments.git

3. Install the required dependencies (assuming you have Python and pip installed):

   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

## Usage

- For instructions:

   ```bash
   ./writegoodcomments.py
   ```

   ```
